Implement toggleFullscreen function that calls document.documentElement.requestFullscreen() to enter fullscreen and document.exitFullscreen() to exit. Add a useEffect hook that listens to the 'fullscreenchange' event on the document to sync button state when the user exits fullscreen via Escape key. In the toolbar section, add a fullscreen toggle button that displays an 'Enter Fullscreen' icon (Maximize or Expand icon) when not in fullscreen mode and an 'Exit Fullscreen' icon (Minimize or Compress icon) when active. Apply conditional styling to the game container so it fills the viewport when in fullscreen mode. Ensure the game canvas dynamically adjusts its dimensions to fill the available space."
