  "summary": "All three requirements appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-8 is satisfied by the Roblox entry in GameLibrary.tsx. REQ-9 is satisfied by the Roblox entry in GamePlayPage.tsx with the correct URL and standard toolbar pattern. REQ-10 is satisfied by Header.tsx showing '11 GAMES' and Footer.tsx listing Roblox. The required thumbnail image is referenced in GameLibrary.tsx but no new image file appears in the diff as an added file; however the diff only tracks LLM-readable files so the binary asset absence is not conclusive evidence of omission.",
