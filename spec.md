# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add Roblox as the 11th game in the Arcade Hub game library with a game card and play page.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Roblox game card to the GameLibrary grid with a thumbnail, "Sandbox" genre badge, title, short description, and "Play Now" button matching the neon arcade theme
- Add a play page at `/play/roblox` that embeds `https://www.roblox.com/games` in a full-width iframe with the standard toolbar
- Update the Header badge to display "11 GAMES"
- Add Roblox to the Footer game list

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see the Roblox card in the game library and click "Play Now" to launch the Roblox games page embedded in the arcade player.
